## Description

    For this project we were tasked to create a program that takes in input from a office manager, that then creates a employee profile.  This profile is then put as part of a team profile page.  Each employee role has specific information that goes along with their position.  Along with these task we were told to wrtie tests for the program as well.  This proved to be a difficult challenge for me and I beleive I  did the whole assignment backwards.  This task is to help organize a teams information.
